# Contributing to KhGateway

First off, thank you for considering contributing to KhGateway. It's people like you that make KhGateway such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, make one! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

## Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then fork KhGateway and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```bash
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-localisation
